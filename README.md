Hi! Thanks for checking out my project. I'm currently building this productivity manager because I want to use a singular app for managing 
and keeping track of my academic progress. Through this app, I reinforced many concepts, like sending GET/POST request to a Flask server. I also 
learned many other skills like styling with Tailwind, implementing a Calendar component, and reading documentation on components. 


This project is far from done, as I am learning as I implement new features, but here are some of the features I'm currently working on!


- Create proper routing in React 
- Create a homepage with a demo program 
- Change styling in Create account pages to match the theme
- Show console logs as popups in Create Account page
- Stop instant refresh when adding calendar event
- Add input for the user's personal Google calendar imports
- Add "Info" icons throughout the page to make navigation easier
- Create a new Database for the user's events
- Add a persistent Weekly goals tab on dashboard
- Add data visualization for pomodoro timers
- Add a daily streak animation upon login in
